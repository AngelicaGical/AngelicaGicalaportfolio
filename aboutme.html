        <h3>personal life</h3>
      <p>
     hi! Iâ€™m Angelica, a first year ACT student .
      I am the second child of the five children of mr. and mrs. Gicala. 
      <p>All I can say about myself is that I didn't much experience the childhood that other children haved experienced. Being a first born daughter has huge responsibility in their shoulder, taking the rule as a second mother for their younger siblings is so hard. Thats why I have a big respect for all the Ate out there.</p> 
       <div class="school">
        <h3>All I can say in ACT program</h3>
        
      <p> actually being enrolled in ACT program is so hard, why? beacuse its so hard studying the program you dont want to study to ,  but because I have no choice, I choose ACT program because practicality hit me, because I saw how difficult life was for my family, so I had no choice but to choose the ACT program   </p>
